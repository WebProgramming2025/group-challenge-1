    <h2>Section One</h2>
    <p>This is Section One of filethree.html. Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the way that a page is displayed. It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means of marking up the structure of a document, not as a way of determining its presentation. Formatting text to appear on a web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear in a printed document.</p>

    <!-- Section Two in filethree.html -->
    <a name="section-two"></a>
    <h2>Section Two</h2>
    <p>This is Section Two of filethree.html. HTML provides a basic structure for documents, but presentation and styling are usually handled through CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). This allows developers to separate structure from style, making it easier to manage and update content.</p>

    <!-- Section Three in filethree.html -->
    <a name="section-three"></a>
    <h2>Section Three</h2>
    <p>This is Section Three of filethree.html. By using the proper HTML tags and attributes, you can create structured, readable documents that are easy for both humans and search engines to understand.</p>
