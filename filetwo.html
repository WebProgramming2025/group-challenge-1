<h1>Formatting text</h1>

<h2>Paragraphs and line breaks</h2> 
Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the 
way that a page is displayed. It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means 
of marking up the structure of a document, not as a way of determining its presentation. 
Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear 
in a printed document.

This 
is 
Cool.
