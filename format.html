    <h1>Formatting text</h1>

    <h2>Paragraphs and line breaks</h2>

    <p>Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the way 
    that a page is displayed.<br> It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means of making 
    up the structure of a document, not as a way of determining its presentation.</p>

    <p>Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear 
    in a printed document.</p>

    <hr>

    cool.
